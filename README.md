## ðŸ“– DESCRIPTION

### ðŸŽ¯ What is it about?

Recreating a new version of [this portfolio website](https://senseilein.github.io/portfolio/) using Bootstrap to showcase my projects as a front-end developer.

## ðŸ’» USAGE

[**>> Visit the Bootstrap version of my portfolio website <<**](https://senseilein.github.io/portfolio-bootstrap-version/)

### ðŸ’¬ User story

```
As a Front-End Developer,
I WANT to have a Bootstrap-powered portfolio webpage
SO THAT I can showcase my technical skills to potential collaborators
```

```
GIVEN the portfolio webpage

WHEN the page is loaded,
THEN it contains a navigation menu, a jumbotron, an "about me" section, a work section and a contact section.

WHEN the user hovers on a link,
THEN they can see a hover effect

WHEN one of the links in the navigation is clicked
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN viewing the section about my work
THEN the section contains titled images of my applications

WHEN presented with the first application
THEN that application's image is larger in size than the others

WHEN images of the applications are clicked
THEN the user is taken to that deployed application

WHEN the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices
THEN the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

```

### âœ… Acceptance Criteria

It's done when:

- [ ] HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- [ ] The HTML document includes a <meta> description with a viewport and content attributes.
- [ ] The HTML document contains a header with a navigation menu.
- [ ] All the links in the navigation menu have an href attribute with a value equals to the corresponding section's id.

- [ ] All images for each deployed application are clickable and contain a descriptive alt attribute.
- [ ] All links function correctly.
- [ ] Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
- [ ] HTML and CSS files are properly commented.
